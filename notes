AngularJS notes

Directives
  * ng-app : defines angularJS application. Need this to start an angular application
    <html ng-app="store">

  * ng-init : defines initial variables in an angular application
    * not good use to use them though, should use a controller instead
    <body ng-controller="StoreController as store">
    * give it an alias too, more common to have it that way.

  * ng-model : provides a direct bind to HTML elements
    * First Name: <input type="text" ng-model="firstName"><br>
    * Provide type validation for application data (number, email, required).
    * Provide status for application data (invalid, dirty, touched, error).
    * Provide CSS classes for HTML elements.
    * Bind HTML elements to HTML forms.
    <input type="email" name="myAddress" ng-model="text">

  * ng-repeat: basically a loop.
    <li ng-repeat = "x in store.product">
      {{ x.name}}    // html

    * x in store product ( similar to a foreach loop in java)
    * the {{ ... }} is what renders on the html page
    * "x in store.product" : store tells us to look at the controller that has
                              an alias as store for StoreController
